    <p style="color: yellow;"> Once, there was a king named Shuddhodana, who ruled over the land of Kapilavastu. He had a son named Siddhartha, who was born with many auspicious signs. The king consulted the sages, who predicted that Siddhartha would either become a great emperor or a great sage. The king wanted his son to follow his footsteps and become a ruler, so he kept him away from all the suffering and sorrow of the world. He gave him everything he wanted and surrounded him with luxury and pleasure.

        Siddhartha grew up to be a handsome and intelligent prince, who excelled in all the arts and sciences. He married a beautiful princess named Yashodhara, and they had a son named Rahula. But Siddhartha was not happy. He felt restless and curious about the world outside the palace. He wanted to know the truth of life and death.
        
        One day, he secretly left the palace with his charioteer Channa, and saw four sights that changed his life. He saw an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a monk. He realized that old age, sickness, and death were inevitable for everyone, and that only by renouncing the worldly attachments could one attain peace and happiness. He decided to leave his family and kingdom, and become a wandering ascetic.
        
        He joined a group of five monks, who practiced severe penances and meditation. He followed their methods for six years, but he did not find the answer he was looking for. He became weak and emaciated, and almost died of starvation. He realized that torturing the body was not the way to enlightenment. He decided to follow a middle path between indulgence and austerity.
        
        He went to a place called Bodhgaya, where he sat under a pipal tree, and vowed not to get up until he attained enlightenment. He meditated for forty-nine days, overcoming many temptations and obstacles. He finally achieved the supreme knowledge of the cause and end of suffering, and became the Buddha, the enlightened one.
        
        He then went to Sarnath, where he met his five former companions, and delivered his first sermon, known as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, or the Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma. He explained the four noble truths and the eightfold path, which are the essence of his teachings. He also performed many miracles and converted many people to his path.
        
        He spent the next forty-five years travelling across India, spreading his message of compassion and wisdom. He founded a community of monks and nuns, called the Sangha, who followed his rules and discipline. He also taught many lay followers, who supported him with food and shelter.
        
        He finally passed away at the age of eighty in Kushinagar, where he attained Parinirvana, or the final liberation from the cycle of birth and death. His relics were distributed among eight kingdoms, who built stupas over them.
        
        
        
        - This is how Lord Vishnu took his ninth avatar as Buddha to teach humanity the way to end suffering.
