    <h1><b><big>KURMA AVATHARAM</big></b></h1><br>
    <p style="color: yellow;">Long ago, the gods and the demons were at war. The gods were losing their strength and power, and the demons were growing stronger and more evil. The gods sought the help of Lord Vishnu, the preserver of the universe. He told them to churn the ocean of milk, where many treasures and secrets were hidden, including amrita, the nectar of immortality. Whoever drank amrita would become invincible and immortal.

The gods agreed to churn the ocean, but they needed the help of the demons, as it was a very difficult task. They also needed a huge mountain as a churning rod, and a giant snake as a churning rope. Lord Vishnu persuaded the demons to join the churning, by promising them a share of the amrita. He also lifted the mountain Mandara and placed it on the back of his second avatar, Kurma, who took the form of a tortoise. He then coiled the snake Vasuki around the mountain, and asked the gods and demons to pull from opposite ends.

The churning began, and many wonderful things emerged from the ocean. There was a wish-fulfilling cow, a divine tree, a celestial nymph, a white elephant, a flying horse, and many jewels and gems. The gods and demons took turns to claim these gifts, but they also faced many dangers. A deadly poison came out of the ocean, which threatened to destroy everything. Lord Shiva came to their rescue and swallowed the poison, but his throat turned blue. A fierce fire</p>
