    <h1><b><big>NARASIMHA AVATHARAM</big></b></h1><br>
    
    <p style="color: yellow;">Long ago, there was a demon king named Hiranyakashipu who was very powerful and arrogant. He hated Vishnu, the preserver god, because Vishnu had killed his brother Hiranyaksha in his previous avatara as Varaha.

Hiranyakashipu performed many austerities and obtained a boon from Brahma, the creator god, that he could not be killed by any animal or human, from inside or outside, by day or night, by any weapon or any means.

Hiranyakashipu then declared himself as the supreme lord of the universe and demanded that everyone worship him. He persecuted anyone who disobeyed him and tried to destroy all the temples and shrines of Vishnu.

However, he had a son named Prahlada who was a great devotee of Vishnu. Prahlada refused to worship his father and instead chanted the name of Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu was furious and tried to kill his son in various ways, but Prahlada was always protected by Vishnu’s grace.

One day, Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada where his god was. Prahlada replied that Vishnu was everywhere and in everything. Hiranyakashipu pointed to a pillar in his palace and asked if Vishnu was in it. Prahlada said yes.

Hiranyakashipu then smashed the pillar with his mace, expecting to find nothing inside. But to his surprise, a loud roar came from the pillar and a strange creature emerged from it. It was Narasimha, the fourth avatara of Vishnu.

Narasimha had the head of a lion and the body of a man, with sharp claws and fangs. He was neither animal nor human, neither inside nor outside, neither day nor night. He grabbed Hiranyakashipu and dragged him to the threshold of the palace. He placed him on his lap and tore open his chest with his claws. He killed him without using any weapon or any means.

Narasimha then roared with anger and looked around for more enemies. His eyes were red with fury and his mane was blazing with fire. No one dared to approach him or calm him down.

Prahlada then came forward and bowed down to Narasimha. He praised him as his lord and savior. He asked him to forgive his father and to be merciful to all living beings.

Narasimha was pleased with Prahlada’s devotion and courage. He caressed his head and blessed him. He then calmed down and resumed his normal form as Vishnu. He embraced Prahlada and made him the king of the demons.

This is how Narasimha avatara of Vishnu saved Prahlada from Hiranyakashipu.</p>
