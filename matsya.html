    <h1><b><big>MATSYA AVTHARAM</big></b></h1><br>
    <p style="color: yellow;">Long ago, a king named Manu was very pious and virtuous. He used to perform rituals and sacrifices to please the gods. One day, he was washing his hands in a river when he felt something in his palm. He looked and saw a tiny fish that spoke to him.

“Please save me, O king! I am afraid of the bigger fish that will eat me. If you protect me, I will reward you in the future.”

Manu was surprised by the talking fish, but he felt pity for it. He decided to keep it in a jar and take it to his palace. He named the fish Matsya, which means fish in Sanskrit.

The fish grew bigger and bigger every day until it could not fit in the jar anymore. Manu transferred it to a bigger vessel, then to a pond, then to a lake, and finally to the ocean. But the fish kept growing and growing until it became as big as a mountain.

Manu realized that this was no ordinary fish, but an avatar of Lord Vishnu, the preserver of the universe. He bowed down to the fish and asked for its blessings.

“Matsya, you are the Lord of all. Why did you come to me in this form? What is your purpose?”

The fish smiled and said, “Manu, you are the best among men. You have been chosen by me to save the world from a great calamity. A terrible flood is coming that will destroy everything on Earth. You must build a large boat and take with you the seeds of all plants, the pairs of all animals, and the seven sages who know the Vedas. I will come to you when the time is right and guide you to safety.”

Manu obeyed the fish’s instructions and built a huge boat. He gathered all the living beings and the sages on board. He waited for the fish to come.

Soon, dark clouds covered the sky and rain started pouring down. The water level rose higher and higher until it submerged everything on Earth. The boat floated on the water, but there was no land in sight.

Then Manu saw the fish coming towards him with a horn on its head. The fish told him to tie a rope to its horn and hold on to it. The fish then swam across the water, pulling the boat behind it.

The fish took Manu and his companions to the highest peak of the Himalayas, where they found dry land. The rain stopped and the water receded. The fish then revealed its true form as Lord Vishnu.

“Manu, you have done well. You have saved yourself and your descendants from extinction. You are now the father of a new humanity. From your line will come many kings and heroes who will rule over the earth with righteousness and justice. I bless you and your progeny with prosperity and happiness.”

Manu thanked Lord Vishnu for his grace and protection. He worshipped him with devotion and gratitude.

The fish then disappeared into the water, leaving behind a legacy of faith and hope.

This is how Matsya avatar of Lord Vishnu saved the world from a great flood.</p>
