    <P  style="color: yellow;">In the present age of Kali Yuga, the world is filled with sin and corruption. The people have forgotten their duties and virtues, and follow their selfish desires. The rulers are unjust and oppressive, and the priests are greedy and hypocritical. The earth is suffering from droughts and famines, and the animals are dying. The gods are unhappy with the state of affairs, and await the arrival of the savior.

        Lord Vishnu, the preserver of the universe, decides to take his tenth and final avatar as Kalki, the destroyer of evil. He is born as the son of a Brahmin named Vishnuyasha, in a small village called Shambhala. He grows up to be a brave and righteous young man, who excels in all the arts and sciences. He learns the Vedas and the scriptures from his father, and masters the skills of archery and swordsmanship from his guru Parashurama.
        
        He marries a princess named Padma, who is an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi, his consort. He also receives a divine white horse named Devadatta, and a powerful sword named Ratna Maru, from Lord Shiva. He then sets out on his mission to destroy the evil forces that have corrupted the world.
        
        He first defeats and kills Kali Purusha, the personification of Kali Yuga, who had taken over the throne of India. He then wages war against the tyrant kings and their armies, who had oppressed the people and defied the gods. He slays them all with his sword, and liberates the earth from their tyranny.
        
        He then establishes a new era of peace and righteousness, known as Satya Yuga, or the age of truth. He rules over his kingdom with justice and compassion, and teaches his subjects the principles of dharma. He also revives the Vedic culture and rituals, and restores the harmony between humans, animals, and nature.
        
        He lives for a thousand years, and then returns to his heavenly abode. He is hailed as the greatest avatar of Lord Vishnu, who saved the world from destruction.
