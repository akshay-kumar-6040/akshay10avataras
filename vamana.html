    <h1><b><big>VAMANA AVATHARAM</big></b></h1><br>

    <P style="color: yellow;">Long ago, there was a demon king named Bali who was very generous and righteous. He conquered the three worlds of heaven, earth and the netherworld with his army and his guru Shukracharya. He dethroned Indra, the king of gods, and took over his palace.

The gods were unhappy and sought the help of Vishnu, the preserver god. Vishnu decided to incarnate as Vamana, a dwarf brahmin, to teach Bali a lesson.

Vamana went to the place where Bali was performing a great sacrifice. He asked Bali for alms as a brahmin. Bali welcomed him and offered him anything he wanted.

Vamana said he only wanted three steps of land measured by his feet. Bali agreed, thinking it was a small request. But as soon as he agreed, Vamana expanded his size and became Trivikrama, the giant form of Vishnu.

With his first step, he covered the earth. With his second step, he covered the heaven. There was no space left for his third step. He asked Bali where he should place it.

Bali realized that Vamana was none other than Vishnu and bowed down to him. He offered his head as the place for his third step. Vamana was pleased with Bali’s devotion and humility. He placed his foot on Bali’s head and pushed him down to the netherworld.

He then restored Indra’s kingdom to him and blessed Bali with immortality and fame. He also granted him a boon that he could visit his subjects once a year on the day of Onam.

This is how Vamana avatara of Vishnu measured the universe with his feet.</p>
