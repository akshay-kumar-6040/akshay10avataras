    <p style="color: yellow;">Long ago, there was a brahmin sage named Jamadagni who had a beautiful wife named Renuka. They had five sons, the youngest of whom was Parashurama. Parashurama was a devoted disciple of Shiva and learned the art of warfare from him. He received an axe from Shiva as a boon.

        One day, Renuka went to fetch water from the river. She saw a handsome king named Kartavirya Arjuna who had a thousand arms and was enjoying in the water with his wives. She felt a momentary attraction for him and lost her concentration. As a result, the pot of water she was carrying broke.
        
        Jamadagni, who had the power of clairvoyance, knew what had happened. He was furious and ordered his sons to kill their mother. The first four sons refused to obey him, but Parashurama, who was loyal to his father, agreed to do so. He took his axe and beheaded his mother.
        
        Jamadagni was pleased with Parashurama and granted him a boon. Parashurama asked for his mother’s life to be restored and his father’s anger to be pacified. Jamadagni agreed and brought Renuka back to life. He also forgave his other sons.
        
        However, Kartavirya Arjuna heard about the incident and decided to take revenge on Jamadagni. He attacked his ashram with his army and killed him. Parashurama was away at that time and when he returned, he saw his father’s dead body. He swore to avenge his death and destroy the kshatriya class who had become arrogant and oppressive.
        
        He took his axe and went on a rampage across the earth. He killed Kartavirya Arjuna and his sons. He fought with many other kings and warriors and defeated them all. He performed a sacrifice in which he offered the blood of the kshatriyas to the gods. He repeated this 21 times until there was no kshatriya left on earth.
        
        He then gave the earth to Kashyapa, a sage, and retired to the Mahendra mountain where he meditated for a long time. He became one of the eight immortals of Hindu mythology.
        
        This is how Parashurama avatara of Vishnu cleansed the earth of evil with his axe.
