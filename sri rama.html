    <P style="color: yellow;">Long ago, there was a noble king named Dasharatha who ruled over the kingdom of Ayodhya. He had three wives, Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra, but no children. He performed a sacrifice to please the gods and received a divine nectar that he distributed among his wives. As a result, they gave birth to four sons, Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana and Shatrughna.

        Rama was the eldest and the most beloved son of Dasharatha. He was the seventh avatar of Vishnu, the preserver god. He was handsome, brave, virtuous and obedient. He married Sita, the daughter of King Janaka of Mithila, who was an incarnation of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and beauty.
        
        One day, Dasharatha decided to crown Rama as his successor. However, Kaikeyi, who was influenced by her wicked maid Manthara, reminded Dasharatha of two boons he had granted her long ago. She asked him to banish Rama to the forest for 14 years and make Bharata the king instead.
        
        Dasharatha was heartbroken but he had to keep his promise. Rama accepted his fate without any complaint and prepared to leave for the forest. Sita and Lakshmana insisted on accompanying him. They left Ayodhya and lived in exile for many years.
        
        Meanwhile, Bharata refused to accept the throne and went to the forest to persuade Rama to return. Rama refused to disobey his father’s command and gave his sandals to Bharata as a symbol of his authority. Bharata placed them on the throne and ruled as Rama’s regent.
        
        During their exile, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana faced many dangers and adventures. They met many sages, allies and enemies. The most notorious enemy was Ravana, the ten-headed king of Lanka, who was a powerful demon. He kidnapped Sita with the help of his sister Shurpanakha and took her to his island.
        
        Rama was devastated by the loss of his wife and searched for her everywhere. He befriended Hanuman, the monkey god, who helped him find Sita’s whereabouts. He also formed an alliance with Sugriva, the king of monkeys, who provided him with an army.
        
        Rama and his allies built a bridge across the ocean and reached Lanka. They fought a fierce war with Ravana and his army. Rama killed Ravana with his divine bow and arrow and rescued Sita.
        
        However, Rama doubted Sita’s purity after her captivity and asked her to prove her chastity by undergoing a fire test. Sita agreed and entered a blazing fire. She emerged unscathed by the grace of Agni, the god of fire, who testified her innocence.
        
        Rama accepted Sita back and returned to Ayodhya with her and Lakshmana after completing 14 years of exile. He was welcomed by Dasharatha who had died of grief soon after his departure. He was crowned as the king and ruled with justice and righteousness for many years.
        
        This is how Rama avatara of Vishnu established dharma on earth with his ideal conduct.
