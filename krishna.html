    <h1><b><big>KRISHNA AVATHARAM</big></b></h1>
    <P style="color: yellow;">Long ago, there was a tyrant king named Kamsa who ruled over the kingdom of Mathura. He had imprisoned his father and usurped the throne. He was also a cousin of Devaki, the wife of Vasudeva. He had heard a prophecy that the eighth son of Devaki would kill him.

        Kamsa decided to kill Devaki and Vasudeva, but they pleaded for their lives. Kamsa agreed to spare them on the condition that they would hand over their children to him. He killed their first six sons as soon as they were born.
        
        The seventh son, Balarama, was miraculously transferred to the womb of Rohini, another wife of Vasudeva. He was an avatar of Shesha, the serpent god who supported Vishnu.
        
        The eighth son, Krishna, was the eighth avatar of Vishnu, the preserver god. He was born at midnight in a prison cell. A divine voice instructed Vasudeva to take him to Gokula, a village of cowherds, and exchange him with the newborn daughter of Nanda and Yashoda.
        
        Vasudeva did as he was told and crossed the river Yamuna with Krishna in a basket. The river parted and a snake protected them from the rain. He reached Gokula and swapped Krishna with the baby girl.
        
        Kamsa came to kill the baby, but she turned into the goddess Durga and warned him that his enemy was still alive. She disappeared and Kamsa was terrified.
        
        Krishna grew up in Gokula as the son of Nanda and Yashoda. He was mischievous, playful and charming. He loved to steal butter, play pranks and flirt with the gopis (cowherd girls). He also performed many miracles and killed many demons sent by Kamsa.
        
        One day, he lifted the Govardhan mountain on his little finger to protect the villagers from a storm sent by Indra, the king of gods. Another day, he danced on the head of Kaliya, a poisonous snake who had polluted the Yamuna river.
        
        He also played his flute with such divine melody that everyone was enchanted by him. He had a special bond with Radha, the most beautiful and devoted of the gopis. They are considered to be the epitome of love and devotion.
        
        When Krishna grew up, he left Gokula and went to Mathura with Balarama. They killed Kamsa and freed their parents. They also restored their grandfather Ugrasena as the king.
        
        Krishna then moved to Dwarka, where he married Rukmini and many other queens. He had many children and grandchildren. He also befriended Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers who were fighting for their rightful kingdom against their cousins, the Kauravas.
        
        Krishna became Arjuna’s charioteer and guide in the Kurukshetra war. He revealed his universal form and taught him the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred scripture that contains his wisdom and philosophy.
        
        Krishna also helped the Pandavas win the war by using his cunning and strategy. He saved them from many dangers and ensured that justice prevailed.
        
        Krishna lived for 125 years and left his body after being shot by a hunter who mistook his foot for a deer’s eye. His departure marked the end of an era and the beginning of Kali Yuga, the age of darkness and ignorance.
        
        This is how Krishna avatara of Vishnu spread joy and harmony on earth with his divine leela (play).
