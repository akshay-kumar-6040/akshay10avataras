    <p style="color: yellow;">
        Long ago, there was a demon named Hiranyaksha who was very powerful and arrogant. He hated the gods and wanted to conquer the three worlds: heaven, earth, and the underworld. He performed many austerities and obtained a boon from Brahma, the creator god, that he could not be killed by any animal or human.

        Hiranyaksha then went on a rampage, attacking and plundering the realms of the gods and the sages. He challenged Indra, the king of heaven, to a fight, but Indra was afraid of him and fled. Hiranyaksha then turned his attention to the earth, which was personified as the goddess Bhudevi. He grabbed her and dragged her to the bottom of the ocean, where he hid her in a dark cave.
        
        The gods were alarmed by this act of violence and appealed to Vishnu, the preserver god, for help. Vishnu agreed to save the earth and restore order. He took the form of a wild boar, called Varaha, and plunged into the ocean.
        
        He searched for Hiranyaksha and Bhudevi in the depths of the water. He finally found them in the cave, where Hiranyaksha was guarding his captive. Varaha charged at Hiranyaksha with his tusks and engaged him in a fierce battle.
        
        The fight lasted for a thousand years, during which time Varaha and Hiranyaksha exchanged blows and insults. Varaha was wounded by Hiranyaksha’s mace, but he did not give up. He used his strength and cunning to dodge Hiranyaksha’s attacks and strike back.
        
        At last, Varaha managed to pierce Hiranyaksha’s chest with his tusk and kill him. He then lifted Bhudevi on his tusk and brought her back to the surface. He placed her gently on her original position and restored her beauty and fertility.
        
        Bhudevi was overjoyed and grateful to Varaha for saving her. She praised him as her lord and protector. She offered him a garland of flowers and asked him to stay with her as her husband.
        
        Varaha smiled and accepted her offer. He then revealed his true form as Vishnu and embraced her. The gods showered them with flowers and celebrated their victory.
        
        This is how Varaha avatara of Vishnu lifted the earth from the ocean and killed Hiranyaksha.</p>
